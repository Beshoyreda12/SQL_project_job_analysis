# Background
In my SQL course, I was introduced to the fascinating world of data engineering and the powerful insights that can be derived from well-structured data. This experience ignited a desire within me to delve deeper into the hidden patterns and trends that lie beneath the surface of raw data. I am particularly interested in uncovering insights that are not immediately visible, leveraging my SQL skills to transform data into meaningful information.

Data comes from my [SQL course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql)

### To achieve this, I have formulated five key questions that will guide my analysis:

1. What are the top-paying data engineer jobs?

2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?

3. What skills are most in demand for data engineers?

4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?

5. What are the most optimal skills to learn based on high salary and demand?

# Tools I Used
To accomplish this project, I harnessed a suite of powerful tools, each bringing unique strengths to the table and they are :-

- **SQL**: Employed for transforming, cleaning, and analyzing the data to extract meaningful insights.

- **PostgreSQL**: Utilized as the database management system to handle and query the datasets.

- **Visual Studio Code**: The code editor used for writing, testing, and debugging SQL queries and scripts.

- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and repository hosting services were used to manage code changes and showcase the project.
# The Analysis
In this section, I dive deep into job postings for data engineers, using my SQL skills to unearth valuable insights. Each step answers key questions about top-paying roles, in-demand skills, and more. Let's explore the data-driven findings that illuminate what makes a data engineering career both rewarding and impactful. ðŸš€
### 1.Top Paying Data Engineering jobs
To identify the highest_paying roles, I filtered data engineer positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlighted the high paying oppertunities in the field.
``` sql
SELECT
    job_title_short,
    job_title,
    salary_year_avg,
    company_dim.name,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_id
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id=company_dim.company_id

WHERE 
    job_title_short='Data Engineer' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE AND
    job_schedule_type= 'Full-time'AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY 
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Unraveling the Top Paying Data Engineering Roles:

In the bustling world of tech, where data engineers are modern-day alchemists, a few roles stand out. Leading the pack, **Data Engineer positions at Engtal** offer a remarkable **$325,000**, promising a lucrative work-from-home opportunity.

**Durlston Partners** follows with $300,000,
while **Twitchâ€™s Director of Engineering** - Data Platform boasts $251,000.

Roles like **Staff Data Engineer and Principal Data Engineer at Signify Technology** and **AI Startup** also promise rewarding salaries around **$250,000**. Companies like **Handshake** and **Movable Ink** add to this elite list, showcasing the high value placed on remote flexibility and competitive compensation.

 **Metaâ€™s Data Engineering Manager** role completes the picture at **$242,000**.
